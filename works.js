    'le_fils_de_lhomme': {
        paintedIn: '1964',
        description: 'Magritte painted it as a self-portrait. The painting consists of' +
            ' a man in an overcoat and a bowler hat standing in front of a low wall, ' +
            'beyond which is the sea and a cloudy sky. The man\'s face is largely ' +
            'obscured by a hovering green apple. However, the man\'s eyes can be ' +
            'seen peeking over the edge of the apple. Another subtle feature is ' +
            'that the man\'s left arm appears to bend backwards at the elbow.'

    'golconde': {
        paintedIn: '1953',
        description: 'The piece depicts a scene of nearly identical men dressed in ' +
            'dark overcoats and bowler hats, who seem to be drops of heavy rain (or ' +
            'to be floating like helium balloons, though there is no actual indication ' +
            'of motion), against a backdrop of buildings and blue sky. The men are ' +
            'spaced in rhombic grids facing the viewpoint and receding back in grid layers.'

        paintedIn: '1937',
        description: 'This painting was commissioned by poet and Magritte patron Edward James' +
            ' and is considered a portrait of James although James\' face is not depicted.' +
            ' This painting was one of three produced by Magritte for the ballroom of James\'' +
            ' London home. The other two were The Red Model (1937) and Time Transfixed (1938).'

    'la_trahison_des_images': {
        paintedIn: '1928',
        description: 'This was painted when Magritte was 30 years old. The picture shows a pipe. ' +
            'Below it, Magritte painted, "Ceci n\'est pas une pipe.", French for ' +
            '"This is not a pipe."'

    'la_condition_humaine': {
        paintedIn: '1933',
        description: 'The Human Condition (La condition humaine) generally refers to two ' +
            'similar oil on canvas paintings by the Belgian surrealist René Magritte. ' +
            'One was completed in 1933 and is in the collection of the National Gallery of ' +
            'Art in Washington DC. The other was completed in 1935 and is part of ' +
            'the Simon Spierer Collection in Geneva, Switzerland. A number of drawings ' +
            'of the same name exist as well, including one at the Cleveland Museum of Art.'

    'les_amants': {
        paintedIn: '1928',
        description: 'Frustrated desires are a common theme in René Magritte’s work. ' +
            'Here, a barrier of fabric prevents the intimate embrace between two lovers, ' +
            'transforming an act of passion into one of isolation and frustration. ' +
            'Some have interpreted this work as a depiction of the inability to fully ' +
            'unveil the true nature of even our most intimate companions.'

    'le_faux_miroir': {
        paintedIn: '1928',
        description: 'Le Faux Miroir presents an enormous lashless eye with a luminous ' +
            'cloud-swept blue sky filling the iris and an opaque, dead-black disc ' +
            'for a pupil. The allusive title, provided by the Belgian Surrealist ' +
            'writer Paul Nougé, seems to insinuate limits to the authority of optical ' +
            'vision: a mirror provides a mechanical reflection, but the eye is ' +
            'selective and subjective. Magritte’s single eye functions on multiple ' +
            'enigmatic levels: the viewer both looks through it, as through a window, ' +
            'and is looked at by it, thus seeing and being seen simultaneously.'

    'la_chambre_decoute': {
        paintedIn: '1952',
        description: 'The Listening Room (La Chambre d\'Écoute, 1952) is an oil on ' +
            'canvas painting by the Belgian surrealist René Magritte which is currently ' +
            'part of the Menil Collection in Houston, Texas. A later version of the ' +
            'painting (also of the same name) was made in 1958 and is held in a ' +
            'private collection. Both paintings feature identical (or near-identical) ' +
            'green apples, but place them in different rooms. In the 1952 version,' +
            ' the room has wood flooring and a glass window with white trim. ' +
            'In the 1958 version, this is replaced by a gray brick room with ' +
            'an arched open-air window.'
